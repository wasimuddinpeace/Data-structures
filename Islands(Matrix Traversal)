Graphs
Node/Vertex (circles)
Edges (lines)
directed graphs
Undirected graphs
Cycles in a grah: Undirected cyclic graph if we start from onre node and end on same node
DIrected acyclic grah(DAG)
Directed cyclic graph
what is path: contains mutliple nodes and A node cannot appear twice in a path

undirected :
Degree of a node: no of nodes coming in and out of undirected graph
Degree of a graph = 2*no of edges

DIrected grpahs:
Indegree and out degree for directed graph:
In coming nodes to a Node is in degree
the no of outgoing nodes from a node is out degree
