Graphs
Node/Vertex
Edges
directed graphs
Undirected graphs
Cycles in a grah: Undirected cyclic graph if we start from onre node and end on same node
DIrected acyclic grah(DAG)
Directed cyclic graph
what is path: contains mutliple nodes and A node cannot appear twice in a path
Degree of a node: no of nodes coming in and out for undirected graph
