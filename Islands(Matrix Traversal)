Graphs
Node/Vertex (circles)
Edges (lines)
directed graphs
Undirected graphs
Cycles in a grah: Undirected cyclic graph if we start from onre node and end on same node

Directed acyclic grah(DAG)
Directed cyclic graph
what is path: contains mutliple nodes and A node cannot appear twice in a path

Undirected :
Degree of a node: no of nodes coming in and out of undirected graph
Degree of a graph = 2*no of edges

Directed grpahs:
Indegree and out degree for directed graph:
In coming nodes to a Node is in degree

the no of outgoing nodes from a node is out degree
Edge weight if no edge weight that we need to consider unit of work

Connected Graphs:

1. Always visit from 1 t0 n nodes.
2. Check if the node ha been visited already, if not start the traveral from there.


for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
  if(!isVis[i]){
       traversal(i); // if the node is not visited, we need to start the node from there. 
    }
}
